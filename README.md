# CMU Interactive Data Science Final Project

* **Online URL**: https://share.streamlit.io/cmu-ids-2020/fp-panda/main/app.py
* **Team members**:
  * Contact person: Faner Lin (fanerl@andrew.cmu.edu)
  * Shuaidong Pan (shuaidop@andrew.cmu.edu)
* **Track**: Narrative

## Work distribution
Faner Lin: Faner researched related topics of fake news detection and discussed with Shuaidong to design different components for the narrative article. Additionally, Faner focused on performing exploratory data analysis on the fake news dataset and designed the component for exploring the number of fake news associated with different subjects, speakers, and generating interactive components for sentiment analysis for different news and sentence-level information for different news. Faner also trained fake news classification model with BERT as the base model and applied interpretability tools lime-text for analyzing the word importance for fake news classification and visualized the importance through highlighted text images. Finally, Faner also participated in composing the final report and constructing the narratives in the article.

Shuaidong Pan: Shuaidong researched related topics and discussed with Faner to design different components for the narrative article. Additionally, Shuaidong also focused on selecting fake news dataset and designing interactive components for entity recognition in news statements and word frequency. He used GloVe embedding and t-SNE to visualize the word frequency in 2d space and applied Name Entity Recognition techniques to extract names and places entities in news statements. Shuaidong also worked on designing and improving the layout of the article and researching related works. Finally, Shuaidong also participated in composing the final report and constructing the narratives in the article.
